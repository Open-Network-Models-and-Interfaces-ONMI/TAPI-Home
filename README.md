### TAPI Main Facts:

- TAPI standardizes a single core technology agnostic specification that abstracts common transport network functions.
  + Decoupling from technology specific functions.

- TAPI model decouples service and resource oriented constructs.
  + This allows recursive application along management architecture, in a multi-carrier environment.

- TAPI model decouples functional/logical and physical oriented constructs.
  + This minimizes impacts due to technology optimization and evolution, without losing power of description.

- TAPI is defined in open-source environment.

### The ecosystem:

- TAPI and TMF
  + Leveraging 20 years of experience in developing standard management interfaces, mainly in TMF for MTNM/MTOSI (aka TMF 814)

- TAPI and ONF Core IM
  + TAPI model is a formal pruning/refactoring of the generic ONF Core IM to customize for transfer over specific interface and make the terminology more familiar to users with experience in transport network modeling.

- TAPI and ITU-T
  + TAPI Technology Specific Models are derived from ITU-T (Ethernet, Digital OTN, Photonic)

- TAPI and MEF
  + TAPI has been extended by all MEF Network Resource Models
  + TAPI has been enhanced by MEF feedbacks
- TAPI and OIF
  + TAPI has been successfully adopted by 2016, 2018 and 2020 OIF Interops

### The  Federation of Standard Models in Open-Source Environment:

The Transport API abstracts a common set of control plane functions such as Network, Topology, Connectivity Requests, Path Computation, OAM, and Network Virtualization to a set of Service interfaces. It also includes support for the following technology-specific interface profiles for Carrier Ethernet (L2), Optical Transport Network (OTN) framework (L1-ODU) and Photonic Media (L0-WDM).
